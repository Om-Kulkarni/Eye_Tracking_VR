# Eye_Tracking_VR
A test environment I created to play around and learn about eye-tracking in Unity VR (Using Vive Pro Eye). It uses a lot of open source materials which can be found for free to get started.

The YT Video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBQ_ps6e71k&t=7344s was a huge help to get me started in VR. I then added the stuff for eye tracking on top of it.

Prerequisite:
- Unity 2021.3 (LTS)
- Vive Pro Eye
